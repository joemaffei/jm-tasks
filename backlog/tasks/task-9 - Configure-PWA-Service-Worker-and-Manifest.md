## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up basic PWA configuration with service worker and web app manifest. Install and configure vite-plugin-pwa to enable Progressive Web App features.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] vite-plugin-pwa installed
- [x] Service worker configured and registered
- [x] Web app manifest created with required fields
- [x] PWA plugin configured in vite.config.ts
- [x] Service worker appears in DevTools
- [x] Manifest appears in DevTools
- [x] App is installable (Lighthouse PWA check passes basic requirements)

## Technical Implementation

**Install Dependency:**

- `vite-plugin-pwa@^0.19.9` (installed version 1.2.0 - latest stable)

**Configure PWA Plugin:**

1. Update `vite.config.ts`:
   - Import vite-plugin-pwa
   - Add PWA plugin with basic configuration:
     - App name: "jm-tasks"
     - Short name: "Tasks"
     - Description: "Personal task management PWA"
     - Display mode: "standalone"
     - Theme color: (choose basic color)
     - Icons: Use placeholder icons initially

2. Create placeholder icons in `public/`:
   - `icon-192x192.png` (placeholder)
   - `icon-512x512.png` (placeholder)
   - Can use simple colored squares initially

**Configure Service Worker:**

- Plugin will generate service worker automatically
- Configure basic caching strategy (NetworkFirst or CacheFirst)
- Set up for offline fallback

**Web App Manifest:**

- Manifest will be generated by plugin
- Verify required fields are present:
  - name, short_name
  - icons
  - start_url
  - display
  - theme_color, background_color

**Verify Setup:**

- Build project (`npm run build`)
- Preview production build
- Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Check DevTools → Application → Manifest
- Verify service worker registers
- Verify manifest loads

## Dependencies

- Task 3 (Vue 3 project initialized)
- Node.js 22 LTS
- npm 10+

## Deliverables

1. vite-plugin-pwa installed and configured
2. Service worker registered and working
3. Web app manifest created
4. Placeholder icons created
5. PWA basic setup verified

## Testing

- Verify service worker registers in DevTools
- Verify manifest loads correctly
- Verify app appears installable (browser shows install prompt or menu option)
- Check Lighthouse PWA audit (should pass basic requirements)
- Test offline functionality (if caching configured)

## Notes

- Placeholder icons are fine initially - proper icons in future task
- Focus on basic PWA setup, not advanced features yet
- Service worker caching strategies can be refined later
- Verify PWA features work before adding more complexity

**Estimated Effort:** 45-60 minutes
**Priority:** Medium (PWA is important but not blocking)
**Labels:** setup, pwa
